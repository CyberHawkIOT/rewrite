Goal: allow members to see the history of data inputs for all check-ins (except for food log).

- Add a page that shows a list of their inputs
- there is a poc of the history page here: https://github.com/mightyhealth/mighty-health-app/compare/feat/poc-datapoints-history?expand=1
- place the button directly in the check in, next to preferences, for history.
- add an icon next to “weight” or “date” so they know that function is available: https://www.figma.com/design/2x9tMswouMEZQlh0ms4P8c?node-id=916-17688#908986648
